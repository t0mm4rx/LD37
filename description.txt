Hi !

-- The game --
The game goal is to exit the room, before the timer is over. To exit the level, you have to open a door, but you can open it only if you have all keys of the level.
But be carefull of monsters that you will have to avoid.

-- Controls --
W/A/S/D or UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT to move.
M to have an overview of the map.
R to restart.


-- The team --
We are two 15-years-old frenchies, Adrien and Tom.
Adrien made the game design, drew sprites, and made the level.
I made all the coding stuffs.
It was our first LD !

-- Technical specs --
We have used a custom game engine based on LibGDX, so in JAVA.

Enjoy !
